**Day 1: 7/28/25 - 2 Hours**

Started Initial Creation Process Using The HackPad Tutorial. Modified it slightly when I decided I wanted double the switches. Did very little research in asking ChatGpt if it was possible to use any Gpio pin to wire. Created a basic schematic in the most efficent wiring way possible. Started creating the pcb.

**Day 2: 7/29/30 - 2.5 Hours**

Tried to Finish the pcb for my board according to how I thought it worked and hackpad tutorial. Finished it only to realize it was a terrible layout for the pcb and could've been way more efficent. Noted the pins on the ESP32 and redid everything. Started with doing the schematic correctly, then with my next knowledge and my careful planning, redid the pcb. After redoing it, I added some final branding. After that, I started creating the case based on the board's dimensions. It was hard figuring out where all the holes went, but eventually me and my friend who helped (and was acredited) did it. <img width="1122" height="952" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4e698f-7404-4f9b-ba1e-0d0ac9d840f4" />

Current State of PCB

**Day 3: 7/30/25 - 1.5 Hours**

Pretty Light Day today. I researched some of my parts after reading the requirements for a highway submission. I am still unsure how I am going to get my pcb. I could supply the parts and have it all soldered together for me, I could have the pcb factory source the parts or I could solder them myself. Still unsure how the whole ordering process works. I also added in some screws to the case today to attach the lid. The basic shell for the Keydeck is done but, the final model is not. I can't figure out how to export my pcb as a 3d model properly. I don't even know if I made it correctly. Gonna figure more of that out tomorrow.

Broken KiCad Step File. Gonna fix tmw hopefully!

**Day 4: 8/2/25 - 1 Hour**

Even though I never got to work on the project on the 31st, i'm now back. Started off today by trying to find out why my pcb cad wasn't fully working. turns out I didn't properly define the edges of my pcb in edge.cuts. fixed it and most of the other errors with my pcb. still some bad things due to the xiao footprint but won't matter because i'm not using the pads by that other cutout. Also worked more on the full cad assembly, specifically after fixing the pcb cad. I researched my parts more and found 3d models for them.  I found a few flaws with my case so I also had help fixing those. Tomorrow, I'm probably gonna make the full assembly and research how I can get the pcb made.
